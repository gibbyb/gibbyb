- 👋 Hi, I’m @gibbyb

- 👀 I’m interested in anything and everything computers. I am a senior at USM for Applied Computer Science, and I work for the City as a PC support technician. In my free time I like to read and ride my bike. I love learning & understanding the world & the people around me.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java. I have decided on Java as the language I want to master first. I have experience with C++ as well. I feel confident that anything I could write in Java, I could also write in C++, given twice the time, but I certainly prefer Java for now. I am working on various projects of my own in order to try and solve problems I encounter, whether at work, or at home. I mostly just need to learn as much as possible, so my projects will probably reflect that.

- 💞️ I would love to collaborate, and would love to hear from any other developers either looking for help on their project, or looking to give me advice on my own projects. Please feel free to reach out to me! I should also mention somewhere in here that some of my projects may not be completely agnostic, and may only work within my job, or may be dependant on software we use specifically. I will label these accordingly to make that clear if so. These projects will be uploaded for version control as well as a way of documenting work for my employers, friends, clients, etc.
